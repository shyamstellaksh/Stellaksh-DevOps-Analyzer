# Stellaksh-DevOps-Analyzer
A collection of browser-based DevOps tools including YAML Analyzer, Terraform Validator, Kubernetes Manifest Checker, Dockerfile Auditor, and more. 100% client-side and safe for enterprise use.

A browser-based, client-side DevOps toolkit that helps engineers validate, debug, and optimize their infrastructure files safely.

No backend. No data stored. 100% secure for enterprise and finance users.

## Tools Included (Roadmap)

✔ YAML Analyzer  
🔜 Terraform Analyzer  
🔜 Kubernetes Manifest Checker  
🔜 Dockerfile Analyzer  
🔜 CI/CD Config Inspector  

## Why this project?

Most DevOps analyzers run in the cloud.  
Companies (especially finance) cannot upload configs externally.

This project solves that.

Everything runs in **your browser only**.
